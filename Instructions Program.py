        Welcome to the greatest intellectual challenge of all time: Tic-Tac-Toe.
        This will be a showdown between your human brain and my silicon processor.
        
        You will make your move known by entering a number, 0 - 8. 
        The number will correspond to the board position as illustrated:

                                0 | 1 | 2
                                ---------
                                3 | 4 | 5
                                ---------
                                6 | 7 | 8   

        Prepare yourself, human. The ultimate battle is about to begin. \n
